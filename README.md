# Safer-Dynamics

## General description 

An intellingent traffic management solution based on AI decision making, image recognition and smart traffic lights.
The goal is to improve traffic flow while maintaining or improving pedestrian safety.

## How it's supposed to work (if it ever will)

An AI processes in real time the video image received from cameras mounted near traffic lights, and based on the data it optimizes traffic flow.

Traffic lights will sync at the speed of the cars. 
If traffic congestion occurs, it will prioritize clearing it while maintaining overall driving fluidity.
